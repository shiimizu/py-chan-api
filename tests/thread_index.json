I enjoyed it a lot.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yusaku vs Bohman</span><br>While a bunch of the duels they had in the past were lack-luster, the final one isn&#039;t. They have the subplot of the Neuron Link killing everyone and the Hanoi squad trying to get a fix for that, Akira smashing that fucking enter key to save the day, the first LINK-5 shown beyond Match Winners, Ai having to sacrifice all his friends for Darkfluid to exist and finally, the summon of Darkfluid allowing for a decently satisfying end to the season<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yusaku vs Go</span><br>Go in his anorexic bounty hunter state is a delight to watch in my opinion. Him doing the whole &quot;Brain Hack&quot; shit cracked me up and having Playmaker out his field using eXceed was cool as fuck. The only thing that really lets it down is the whole &quot;SECOND ACTIVATION&quot; of Neo Storm Access. They should&#039;ve had Go develop a change of heart or get so arrogant that he allows them to use it rather than the pure retardation that occurred there.<br>Go vs Earth was also neat mostly because of the dissection scene which was honestly the most depressing fucking scene in this show watching Earth beg for his life to deaf ears",
